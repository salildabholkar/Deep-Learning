# Deep Learning Projects
Repository for hosting any interesting deep learning projects I am currently working on

## Current projects:
* [Game of Life](GameOfLife) - Neural network wich can produce an entire game of life simulation
* [FoolNet](https://salildabholkar.github.io/2017/08/17/what-you-see-is-not-what-you-get/) - Using the backpropogation in neural nets to create images capable of fooling image classification systems (done with Inception V3)
* [SarcDetect](https://salildabholkar.github.io/projects/2018/09/15/ulmfit-sarcasm-detection/) - Detecting sarcasm in English tweets using transfer learning (ULMFiT)

## Running these projects

### General Requirements
* python 3
* pip 3

### Clone the project
Clone the project to your local machine using:

    git@github.com:salildabholkar/Deep-Learning.git

### Run the desired project:
Make sure `python 3` is being used by doing `python --version`

The individual project directories have specific instructions on how to run them
